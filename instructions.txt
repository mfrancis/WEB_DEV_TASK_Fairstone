Mediocre Mushrooms have hired you as a developer.
They started building a website with two pages, using code they found from the internet, 
but they can't seem to figure out why it doesn't quite work how they expected it would.

Now you have been onboarded to the company. they would like you to fix what they started, 
then they will give the time to build them a new site from scratch. 

They don't need to sell mushrooms online, but they might want to have categories of pages etc 
down the line as it grows such as product pages without the need for ecommerce. 
The system should ideally have a CMS or way to allow an admin to add a product to the site in the future.

We Recommend spending no longer than 3 hours on this as this should be possible in that time frame. 

Task 1 - Create a GitHub repository to add these files to it, make sure it is set to public. 

Task 2 - Find The things that are broken in this basic two page site and adjust the code to fix them. 
Look for more technical things such as issues with code or directories not so much spelling and grammar mistakes.
You can attach a txt file explaining why you have done things if you choose to do, 
might be useful if you spot something incorrect , but unsure how to fix it.

Task 3 - Briefly describe what route you suggest going down for developing a new website that will be able 
to deliver what is required and why. ( A paragraph or two is more than enough , doesn't need to be extensive research ).

When you are happy with the project send over the github repo link to your recruiter to send back to Fairstone.
